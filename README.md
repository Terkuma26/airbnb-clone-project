## Features
### 1. User Authentication (Signup/Login)
Secure user authentication lets guests and hosts sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures a personalized experience and protects sensitive information.

### 2. Property Listings
Hosts can create and manage property listings with details such as price, photos, amenities, and availability. This serves as the foundation of the platform, providing travelers with options to choose from.

### 3. Search and Filters
Users can search for properties by location, date, price, and amenities. This improves usability by helping travelers quickly narrow down results to find the perfect stay.

### 4. Booking System
Guests can reserve properties for specific dates and make payments securely. This replicates Airbnb’s core functionality, ensuring smooth interactions between hosts and guests.

### 5. Reviews and Ratings
Guests can rate their stay and leave reviews, while hosts receive valuable feedback. This feature fosters trust and transparency, making the platform more reliable.

### 6. Messaging System
A built-in chat system allows communication between hosts and guests. This makes it easy to clarify booking details, ask questions, and enhance the overall user experience.

### 7. Payment Integration
Integration with a secure payment gateway allows guests to pay for bookings online. It streamlines the process and makes the platform viable for real-world transactions.

### 8. Wishlist/Favorites
Users can save properties they like to revisit later. This adds convenience and helps guests compare different options before finalizing a booking.

### 9. Admin Dashboard
An admin panel enables administrators to manage users, properties, and transactions. It helps maintain platform security, prevents misuse, and ensures smooth operation.

## API Security.
## Security Measures
### 1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only verified users can log in and access the platform. Secure password hashing, email verification, and token-based sessions (e.g., JWT) protect user accounts from unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to define permissions for guests, hosts, and administrators. This ensures users only access features relevant to their role, preventing unauthorized actions.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting prevents brute-force attacks and abuse of the API by restricting the number of requests from a single user or IP within a specific time frame. This helps maintain performance and stability.

### 4. Data Encryption
All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS/SSL. Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment details, is also encrypted at rest to ensure confidentiality.

### 5. Input Validation
User inputs are validated and sanitized to guard against common security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures the platform safely processes external data.

### 6. Secure Payment Processing
Payments are handled by trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). This keeps financial information secure and ensures compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS.

## Importance of Security
### 1. Protecting User Data
Users share sensitive information such as names, emails, and addresses. Strong security ensures this data remains private, building trust and preventing identity theft.

### 2. Securing Payments
Financial transactions involve credit card and banking details. Secure payment handling protects users from fraud and ensures compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS.

### 3. Authentication
Authentication safeguards accounts so only verified users can access them. This prevents unauthorized logins and protects user profiles, bookings, and communication.

### 4. Authorization
Authorization ensures that guests, hosts, and admins only access the features relevant to their roles. This prevents misuse of privileged functionality and protects system integrity.

### 5. Preventing Abuse (Rate Limiting)
Rate limiting stops malicious actors from overwhelming the system with repeated requests. It helps prevent brute-force attacks and keeps the platform stable for all users.

### 6. Data Integrity
Encryption and input validation protect the platform from tampering and malicious injections. This ensures that stored and transmitted data cannot be altered or exploited.

## CI/CD Pipeline. 
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.  
They ensure that new features or fixes are quickly integrated, tested for errors, and deployed without manual intervention.  
This improves development speed, reduces bugs in production, and keeps the project reliable and up to date.

## CI/CD Tools
Several tools can be used to implement CI/CD pipelines in this project:
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows such as testing, building, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker** – Provides containerization, ensuring the application runs consistently across different environments.  
- **Jenkins** – An open-source automation server that can manage complex CI/CD workflows.  
- **GitLab CI/CD** – Integrated pipelines with GitLab repositories for seamless version control and deployment.  
- **Travis CI** – A CI/CD service that automates testing and deployment for projects hosted on GitHub.  
- **Kubernetes** – Used for orchestrating Docker containers in production, enabling scalable and reliable deployments.  
- **Heroku / AWS / Azure / GCP** – Cloud platforms that can host and manage automated deployments.
